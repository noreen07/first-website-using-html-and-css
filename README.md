# first-website-using-html-and-css
This is the very first website I built on my own using the basics of HTML and CSS. 
Upon learning HTML and CSS, I wanted to practice without using any prompts. I created this basic website from scratch in order to help develop my html and css skills.
The website is very basic - it is inspired by a local farmer whom I know. She cultivates her own produce and creates delicious homemade meals with it.
This inspired me to create a website where a user can place an order on a meal and have the opportunity to contact the owner in order to learn more about the produce/ingredients.
